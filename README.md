# 03-JavaScript-Password-Generator

## Summary

This application enables employees to generate a random password based on criteria selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. The app lets users choose their password's length and what types of characters they would like to include. It then generates the password as both an alert and within the browser window.
